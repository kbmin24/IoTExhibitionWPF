            This module works by using temperature and humidity sensors (DHT22). This sensor is connected to raspberry pi, which is a mini computer. A program on the raspberry pi will then read the data from the sensor.
            <LineBreak/><LineBreak/>How this data gets sent to this computer is a bit more complex, but not as much as you might expect. On the raspberry pi, a web server application is operating, like any other websites you may see. If you access that website, it will return you the data read off from the sensor: temperature and humidity level.
            <LineBreak/><LineBreak/>This dashboard program will automatically access the website served by the raspberry pi, and retrieve the value from there, like you would search google using a web browser. During this process, a structured data format called ‘JSON’ is used.
            <LineBreak/><LineBreak/>Note that these kinds of data storage and retrieval methods are widely employed, and is called the ‘RESTful API’.
